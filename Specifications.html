        <p> The purpose of this website is to help people quickly pick out the movies they will enjoy and to allow users to rate and access said movies. Unlike standard movie websites, our websites will instill a sense of community within fellow movie-goers by providing a multitude of ways for users to communicate and share there love of movies. One essential way of doing this will be by adding movie lists with facebook integration so users may make lists for their facebook friends of their favorite movies. Future potential ideas may include live chat rooms for streaming movies so you can talk with your friends while watching movies from the comfort of your couch. Our team also thought the idea of a "twitch" chat for movies would provide a very interesting dynamic for movie watchers.</p>

       	</h1>
       	<p> From the home page of the website, users will be able to navigate our database of rated movies, possibly through filters to search for movies recommended to them by our rating system. The website itself will search for streaming services for the user and deliver them to those websites. When users select a movie there will also be an option for them to join a chat for said movie. We will also have an option to view chat rooms of movies so a user can see what movies are being watched and talked about by others</p>

       	</h1>
       	<p>Our database will utilize MongoDB and NodeJS since none of us know how to use said technologies we will have to learn them and then implement them.
