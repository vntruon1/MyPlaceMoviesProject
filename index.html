  <h2> What is MyPlace Movies?</h2>
	  <p>MyPlace Movies (MPM) is a personal hub for movie enthusiasts to rate, discuss, and comment about all movies that exist. We believe that movies should be a shared experience among friends and peers. The problem is the constant question of if a movie is fun, scary, or just worth watching. At MyPlaceMovies the process of picking a movie and watching with friends should be seamless and instant. After all, nothing sounds more inviting with friends than my place and a movie. </p>
  <h2> How does MyPlace Movies work?</h2>
	  <p> MyPlace Movies works with something we call a "Worth it" rating. We look at multiple factors such as length of the movie, format watched(Theatre,rental, streaming, purchase), enjoyment, and various other things and then determine if that movie is actually "worth it". </p>
  <h2> Okay, but what else is MyPlace Movies?</h2>
	  <p>Not only can you look up movies and see its reviews at MPM, you can search for the formats in which the movie can be accessed. Not sure if it is on Netflix or other streaming sites? Just type your movie in and we will let you know! Once you have found the movie of your choice, you can easily and seamlessly invite your friends and guests over via Facebook and messaging. You can even create a watchlist where you can simply add movies you want to watch later.</p>
